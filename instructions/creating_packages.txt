The only thing an npm package requires is the {bold}package.json{/bold} file.

This file can be generated with the {bold}`npm init`{/bold} command.

{bold}`npm init`{/bold} will prompt you for information about your package.

Answer these questions and your {bold}package.json{/bold} will be generated in the current directory.

This command will also pick up any modules in the {bold}node_modules/{/bold} directory and add them as dependencies in your {bold}package.json{/bold}
